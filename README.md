# Feature Engineering and Model Evaluation Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will practice basic feature engineering techniques and evaluate a machine learning model. Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance, and proper evaluation ensures you understand how well your model generalizes.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find two function definitions: `create_polynomial_features(X)` and `evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred)`.
3.  Your task is to implement these functions:
    *   `create_polynomial_features`: Create polynomial features (e.g., degree 2) from the input features `X`.
    *   `evaluate_model`: Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score for the given true and predicted values.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   Explore other feature engineering techniques, such as interaction terms, one-hot encoding, and binning.
*   How can you use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance?
*   Explore other evaluation metrics for regression and classification tasks.
